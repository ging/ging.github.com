abstract = {Objective
To implement and assess the impact of a Vascular Surgery-themed Escape Room on medical student motivation, satisfaction, and engagement in CanMEDS roles.
Design
The authors designed an Escape Room combining Vascular Surgery objectives, knowledge-based problems and technical skills into Vascular Surgery-themed stations. Groups of 3 to 4 medical students participated in the activity. Data collected included time to escape, CanMEDS roles covered during the activity, debriefing interview session, and satisfaction survey.
Setting
The Escape Room was installed at the University of Ottawa Skills and Simulation Centre at the Ottawa Hospital, a tertiary care center.
Participants
Medical students in their preclerkship years of study were invited to participate in the Escape Room. In total, 13 medical students completed the experience, divided into 4 groups.
Results
Thirteen medical students divided into 4 groups participated in the Escape Room. Two teams used a collaborative strategy to complete the activity and successfully escaped with an average time of 53.6 minutes, whereas only 1 of the 2 teams completing the experience employing an individualistic strategy successfully escaped. Following the experience, 83% of participants stated that the experience motivated them to prepare beforehand and believed that the experience consolidated the knowledge that they had read. All the participants also reported that the experience encouraged the use of the CanMEDS communicator and collaborator roles. As well, 76.9% of students mentioned that they enjoyed the practical exercises incorporated into the experience and 53.8% stated that they would like to see the Escape Room format included in the medical curriculum.
Conclusions
By combining knowledge-based problems, key learning objectives, technical skills, and CanMEDS themes into the Escape Room, the authors have developed a learning platform that may be more enjoyable and provide an adjunct to traditional didactic lectures.},

abstract = {Background and purpose
In addition to clinical knowledge, teamwork and critical thinking are skills necessary to be successful during advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs). One way that educators can help students to achieve these skills is with the utilization of educational games.
Educational activity and setting
Faculty from different departments worked together to develop an educational activity modeled after the escape room game concept for third year pharmacy students enrolled in a pre-APPE readiness course.
Findings
The knowledge pre-assessment mean was 81 ± 11.6, with a range of 53 to 105. The mean score following the escape game activity was 79 ± 14.5, with a range of 41 to 100. On average, students scored 3 points lower on the post-assessment (−2.8 ± 13.4). Despite the decrease in overall mean scores from pre-assessment to post-assessment, the overwhelming majority of students (96%, n = 51) felt that this exercise improved clinical skills and facilitated learning.
Summary
The escape room activity was developed in such a way that it focused on teamwork, critical thinking, problem solving, and the integration of didactic coursework with the intent that the students could apply their knowledge in a simulated scenario. The students viewed the activity in an overwhelmingly positive light, and their perceptions of the impact of the activity on their ability to think critically and integrate content from their previous courses indicated that the game format has the potential to impact student skills in these areas.},

abstract = {Abstract Introduction A UK dermatology curricula review has argued that undergraduate delivery relies on lectures and is subject to clinical and staffing pressures. Many UK undergraduate students feel less than adequately prepared to manage dermatological conditions and misconceptions are common regarding dermatology. Educators have called for innovative solutions, including small group teaching. Escape rooms are games requiring teams to solve puzzles to escape from a room. Aim This study aimed to assess impact of an escape room game on perceptions of dermatology amongst undergraduate medical students. Methods Students were invited to an escape room to consolidate lessons taught in a previous lecture. Students were first asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their preferred learning environments, perceptions of dermatology and confidence in content. Following the escape room these questions were revisited. Focus groups were then held to explore themes raised. Results 16 students took part in escape room sessions, and 3 focus groups. Feedback was strongly positive, with 100% of students expressing ‘strongly agree' on whether they enjoyed the session. Qualitative data were coded for themes of accessibility, variety of taught content and awareness. 94% of students stated the escape room made them want to experience more dermatology. Discussion Prejudices regarding dermatology exist amongst medical students, and may act as a barrier to perceived accessibility to the specialty. Escape rooms can provide a shift to a more learner-centred approach which may aid in combatting negative perceptions. They may act as an enjoyable means of consolidating lecture-based and clinical teaching, requiring minimal resources. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background This teaching project describes the process of creating, implementing, and appraising the use of escape room concepts within a urosepsis high-fidelity simulation scenario. Method Instead of a locked room, Breakout EDU locked boxes were incorporated into a clinical simulation. Nursing students applied concepts learned in class and analyzed patient data to obtain clues. These clues helped determine the combination to four locks and progress through the simulation within 60 minutes. After completing the escape room simulation, each group had an opportunity to gather for a team photo, which they posted on social media. Results Students reported the escape game contributed to their learning and improved their ability to delegate tasks and work as a team. Preliminary observations reveal that “time” may be a significant factor associated with this teaching strategy. Conclusion The concept of an escape room or serious game-based learning was found to be an engaging teaching strategy by faculty and students.},

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
We created a radiology Escape Room, a competitive game where a team of players must discover clues and solve a mystery to escape a “locked” room. To succeed, players must collaborate and think critically and creatively. Our objectives were to provide a novel team-building activity, teach interesting content about radiology as a specialty, cultivate grit, and share the game with other programs.
Materials and Methods
Escape Rooms were held during orientation (BOOT Camp) for incoming radiology residents and for upper level residents and faculty with advanced content (four teams totaling 20 residents and faculty). We repeated the Escape Room 27 times for 144 residents from more than 10 countries at Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 2018.
Results
Players were engaged and competitive. They were able to connect the activity to their future responsibilities – analyzing knowledge under pressure (being on call), communicating effectively (conveying results and recommendations), having the dexterity and motor skills required for physical puzzles (hand-on procedures), being able to multi-task and come up with differential diagnoses under extreme stress and time pressure (being on call). A post-RSNA survey confirmed satisfaction with the activity, with overall enjoyment receiving the highest rating.
Conclusion
It is feasible to create a portable, inexpensive Escape Room as a novel educational platform for radiology residents. Combining knowledge-based challenges and technical skills in a live-action game simulated a real-life situation in which vital patient information must be collected and reported concisely and accurately. A Game Guide is available to program directors and medical educators upon request.},

abstract = {Background and purpose
Serious educational gaming success has not been replicated in a nonsterile compounding practical skill-based course. The objective of this study was to create a nonsterile compounding escape room to evaluate third-year professional pharmacy students' (1) knowledge of nonsterile compounding and (2) perceptions of educational escape room gaming utilized in nonsterile compounding.
Educational activity and setting
The escape room gaming environment used puzzles focused on advanced topics of nonsterile compounding. To evaluate students' knowledge, all participating students completed a pre-assessment and post-assessment mapped to the course objectives. To assess student perceptions of educational escape room gaming, a previously-validated, 12-item survey on student perceptions of educational escape room gaming was modified and administered at the end of the activity. Additional influencing factors such as success in the activity and previous escape room gaming experience were collected.
Findings
All thirty students completed the assessments and perception survey (100% response rate). Three out of four student teams successfully escaped the room. Students' knowledge improved or stayed the same for all questions of the assessment questions. Students perceived the escape room as helpful to their learning. Students' increased knowledge and positive perception were independent of their teams' escape success.
Summary
Students were actively engaged in learning during a nonsterile compounding escape room. Escape room educational games may be successfully applied to nonsterile compounding to yield increased student knowledge and positive perceptions.},

In the pedagogical domain, learning theories had been enforced and embedded to all instructional materials especially on gamification. Gamification is a concept of game-based approach in the teaching and learning process by offering challenges, tasks, rewards, badges and assessment. An android-based application called C-Rocks had been used in this study which comprises three learning theories: constructivism, behaviourism and instructivism. A pretest was conducted to the fifty first year IT students who learned C programming in a traditional way of teaching to determine their prior knowledge. After that, the C-rocks was used by the students to facilitate the learning of C programming. A post-test was conducted to determine the post-knowledge gained after using the android app. The students were clustered using the k-means clustering algorithm of educational data mining to good, medium, and poor standard students. It was found out that most students excelled in variable topic while they performed least in the control statement topic. A T-test was also utilized and showed that the result of pretest and post-test is highly significant with a t-value of 7.236 and a probability of 0.000. With the result established, the C-android app containing three learning theories is an effective Gamified tool in learning C programming as students can achieve greater learning.},

abstract = {As health professions education evolves toward active learning environments, interest in using games as an educational tool is increasing. One contemporary commercial game that has design potential for learning activities is an “escape” or “breakout” room. Escape rooms are live-action games where teams of players work to achieve a common goal in a set amount of time. Limited literature is available assessing this type of gaming format for education design. This study investigated the design and implementation of an escape room learning activity in a third-year pharmacy infectious disease elective course at the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy.During a Gram-positive antimicrobial resistance module, third-year pharmacy students participated in both patient case-based instruction and an escape room learning activity. Three IRB-approved surveys were distributed electronically to students; the first was completed prior to class and functioned as a standard teaching tool to assess mastery of content based on pre-assigned reading and previous coursework. Two surveys were completed after the session to assess knowledge and perceptions gained during each learning activity. Students answered multiple-choice knowledge-based questions and then responded to five statements using a Likert scale from 1 to 7 (1 = Not at all, 4 = Somewhat, and 7 = Very much) to indicate perceptions of each instructional activity.Nineteen students participated in the study. The mean correct scores for knowledge-based assessment were 90.5\\% in the pre-class survey, 82.1\\% in the post-case survey, and 90.5\\% in the post-escape room survey. There was an overall positive perception of both learning activities based on results of the survey questions. The escape room learning activity was preferred by 18 of 19 students (94.7\\%), but only 11 of 19 (57.9\\%) indicated they learned better from the escape room.This study illustrates an escape room designed to meet lecture learning objectives is a feasible active learning technique. While students demonstrated knowledge gained from the activity and indicated positive perceptions, this approach warrants further evaluation.All authors: No reported disclosures.},

abstract = {Background: According to previous studies on nursing education, although the use of games can produce positive results, the vast majority are based on questions and answers or on clinical situations. As an alternative, the ‘Escape Room' teaching game is a much more dynamic option to asses theoretical and practical knowledge, and it may also promote teamwork and the ability to perform under pressure. Objectives: To analyse nursing students' opinions and study motivations after using the nursing ‘Escape Room' teaching game. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Participants: Second-year nursing students enrolled in the ‘Adult Nursing 1' subject. Method: After completing the teaching game, the students who had taken part in it were asked to fill in an ad-hoc questionnaire on the matter. In this game, students have 30 min in which they must solve the riddles and puzzles presented, and thus escape. In doing so, they must demonstrate both theoretical and practical knowledge, and a teacher will remain in the classroom to assess whether the nursing techniques in question are correctly performed. Results: The nursing students who took part in the game strongly believed that this ‘helped them learn the subject' (4.8 points) and that ‘more games of this type should be included in their nursing studies' (4.8 points). Overall, they considered that ‘the game was enjoyable' (4.6 points), ‘helped them in the exam' (4.6 points), and ‘motivated them to study' (4.5 points). Conclusions: The ‘Escape Room' is a useful game; it stimulates learning, is fun to play, and motivates studying.},

abstract = {Objective. To design an educational game that will increase third-year professional pharmacy students' knowledge of diabetes mellitus disease management and to evaluate their perceived value of the game. Methods. Faculty members created an innovative educational game, the diabetes escape room. An authentic escape room gaming environment was established through the use of a locked room, an escape time limit, and game rules within which student teams completed complex puzzles focused on diabetes disease management. To evaluate the impact, students completed a pre-test and post-test to measure the knowledge they've gained and a perception survey to identify moderating factors that could help instructors improve the game's effectiveness and utility. Results. Students showed statistically significant increases in knowledge after completion of the game. A one-sample t-test indicated that students' mean perception was statistically significantly higher than the mean value of the evaluation scale. This statically significant result proved that this gaming act offers a potential instructional benefit beyond its novelty. Conclusion. The diabetes escape room proved to be a valuable educational game that increased students' knowledge of diabetes mellitus disease management and showed a positive perceived overall value by student participants.},

@article{Dietrich2018,
abstract = {An “escape game” activity is proposed to increase stimulation, team group skills, and adaptability in the chemistry classroom. The students follow in the footsteps of Nicolas Leblanc, a young French chemist, who took part in a contest launched by the French Academy of Sciences in 1775 to produce industrial soda ash. By means of scientific puzzles, such as using the periodic table, balancing a reaction, drawing up a flowsheet, or performing simple mole calculations, students will access combinations of numbers that allow them to open mechanisms present in the room that give them access to other enigmas. Following a precise sequence (controlled by the teacher present in the room), the students will thus advance in groups by retracing the development of one of the first industrial processes in the world. Escaping from the room is not the end of the activity: a debriefing will highlight the key elements of the construction of this process and will indicate the resources for further research, notably on the environmental consequences of the Leblanc process and the passing of the alkali act, one of the first laws to limit atmospheric pollution in the world. To simplify the principle of classical “escape games”,a classroom version, based on an easily printable paper sheet and locked file folders, is proposed in this paper},

@article{KINIO2019134,
abstract = {Objective To implement and assess the impact of a Vascular Surgery-themed Escape Room on medical student motivation, satisfaction, and engagement in CanMEDS roles. Design The authors designed an Escape Room combining Vascular Surgery objectives, knowledge-based problems and technical skills into Vascular Surgery-themed stations. Groups of 3 to 4 medical students participated in the activity. Data collected included time to escape, CanMEDS roles covered during the activity, debriefing interview session, and satisfaction survey. Setting The Escape Room was installed at the University of Ottawa Skills and Simulation Centre at the Ottawa Hospital, a tertiary care center. Participants Medical students in their preclerkship years of study were invited to participate in the Escape Room. In total, 13 medical students completed the experience, divided into 4 groups. Results Thirteen medical students divided into 4 groups participated in the Escape Room. Two teams used a collaborative strategy to complete the activity and successfully escaped with an average time of 53.6 minutes, whereas only 1 of the 2 teams completing the experience employing an individualistic strategy successfully escaped. Following the experience, 83% of participants stated that the experience motivated them to prepare beforehand and believed that the experience consolidated the knowledge that they had read. All the participants also reported that the experience encouraged the use of the CanMEDS communicator and collaborator roles. As well, 76.9% of students mentioned that they enjoyed the practical exercises incorporated into the experience and 53.8% stated that they would like to see the Escape Room format included in the medical curriculum. Conclusions By combining knowledge-based problems, key learning objectives, technical skills, and CanMEDS themes into the Escape Room, the authors have developed a learning platform that may be more enjoyable and provide an adjunct to traditional didactic lectures.},
