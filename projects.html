Lynckia supports connections from desktop, tablet and mobile phone with Android and Chrome Beta, so it will be desirable that Erizo could deal with different screen sizes and connection bandwidth. The group already implemented a similar component in Flash, but now, in Lynckia, it has to be refactored in C++ for WebRTC videos.
