A systematic review approach was used to analyze 41 articles from recognized digital databases. The results of the review provide a comprehensive understanding of previous research related to the use of Transformers models in education for the task of sentiment analysis, their benefits, challenges, as well as future areas of research that can lay the foundation for a more sustainable and effective education system.},

abstract = {Procrastination is one of the most common problems among students causing mental health issues, low motivation, and poor academic performance. The emergence of Learning Management Systems has made it possible to accurately pinpoint when procrastination takes place due to the unobtrusive collection of fine-grained data from students. However, most studies that analyze procrastination regard it as an intrinsic characteristic of students. In this work, we study procrastination as a process that unfolds with time. We use sequence analysis to map the evolution of students' procrastination behavior over a task-oriented programming course. Our findings evince that students' procrastination is not constant throughout a course and that students who tend to procrastinate are those who achieve worse academic performance.},

  abstract = {As networks get more complex, the ability to track almost all the flows is becoming of paramount importance. This is because we can then detect transient events impacting only a subset of the traffic. Solutions for flow monitoring exist, but it is getting very difficult to produce accurate estimations for every <flowID,counter> tuple given the memory constraints of commodity programmable switches. Indeed, as networks grow in size, more flows have to be tracked, increasing the number of tuples to be recorded. At the same time, end-host virtualization requires more specific flowIDs, enlarging the memory cost for every single entry. Finally, the available memory resources have to be shared with other important functions as well (e.g., load balancing, forwarding, ACL).To address those issues, we present FlowLiDAR (Flow Lightweight Detection and Ranging), a new solution that is capable of tracking almost all the flows in the network while requiring only a modest amount of data plane memory which is not dependent on the size of flowIDs. We implemented the scheme in P4, tested it using real traffic from ISPs and compared it against four state-of-the-art solutions: FlowRadar, NZE, PR-sketch, and Elastic Sketch. While those can only reconstruct up to 60\% of the tuples, FlowLiDAR can track 98.7\% of them with the same amount of memory.},

	year = {2025},
	abstract = {This study examined the ability of a large language model, GPT-4o mini, to predict age of acquisition (AoA) for Spanish words, as compared to human ratings. We found a strong correlation (ρ=.75) between the model's AoA estimates and mean human ratings. This correlation was lower than the level of agreement observed between individual human raters (ρ=.85), but we found that finetuning the model on a relatively small dataset of 2000 human AoA ratings has the potential to enhance the model's performance to a level comparable to human consensus. Consistent with theoretical expectations, our analyses confirmed that AoA estimates are meaningful only for words within an individual's vocabulary. Finally, we present a novel dataset of AoA estimates for 28,453 Spanish words likely known by adult speakers.},
