                    <p>The event commemorates the first ISABEL distributed event, namely ABC94, the second Summer
                        School on Advanced Broadband Communication organized in July 1994 by the BRAIN project. It
                        was a 3 day event connecting 5 auditoriums located in Spain, Portugal and Switzerland. Speakers
                        and attendees could attend in any of the sites. ISABEL connected over pioneering ATM broadband
                        infrastructures to demonstrate the power of broadband applications. This anniversary event will
                        connect again participants from all over the world.</p>

                    <p>This first event used the Telefónica RECIBA ATM testbed at Telefónica I+D in Madrid, set up by
                        Pedro Chas and his team: Andres Gonzalez Molina, Pedro Lizcano, Francisco Herrera, Luis
                        Merayo, Juan Ignacio Solana and others. RECIBA was connected with a 155Mbps link to the UPM
                        site in Madrid set up by the ISABEL team, leaded by Juan Quemada and including initially: Tomas
                        de Miguel, Arturo Azcorra, Santiago Pavón, Joaquín Salvachúa, David Larrabeiti and Manuel Petit.
                    </p>

                    <p>RECIBA was also connected with a 34Mbps line to the RIA ATM testbed at CET in Aveiro, set up
                        by Vasco Lagarto and his team: Jose Domigues, Joao Bastos, Francisco Fontes and others. RIA
                        was connected with a 34 Mbps link to the University of Aveiro site set up by Manuel de Oliveira,
                        Rui Aguiar & others. The Basel site and ATM testbed were connected to RIA by a 2Mps satellite
                        link.</p>

                    <p>The ISABEL application was created in 1993 in the ISABEL project by the ISABEL team at UPM.
                        The application got operational only in 1994 within the IBER project and was used to organize,
                        ABC94, the second BRAIN Summer School on Advanced Broadband Communication as a
                        distributed event connecting 5 sites: two in Madrid (Telefónica I+D and UPM), two in Aveiro (CET
                        and the University of Aveiro), and one in Basel.</p>

                    <p>In 1994 the state of the art videoconferencing systems available where point-to-point with
                        dedicated ISDN connections sending only audio and video. Multipoint conference systems required
                        the expensive H320 MCU hardware and were very rigid.</p>

                    <p>ISABEL supported collaborative video-conferencing with a floor control coordinating the proper
                        configuration of audio, video, slides, pointers and other multimedia components. ISABEL
                        workstations were connected with TCP/IP over the ATM and satellite broadband infrastructures.
                    </p>

                    <p>Isabel was then the only high-quality multicast-capable video-conference application featuring
                        various qualities of services for different types of connections. This allowed seamless
                        interconnection over ATM of sites at 10 Mb/s, with sites connecting with links ranging from
                        128Kb/s
                        to 2Mb/s. In ABC96, the 4th Summer School, over 20 sites were connected with the different
                        bandwidths needed to reach all the remote sites.</p>

                    <p>Many distributed events followed ABC94 (listed at the end). They were made possible by the
                        ecosystem created by European programs, with large collaborations among operators (Telefónica,
                        Portugal Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, etc.), research (UPM, U. Aveiro, IJS, BADLab, etc.),
                        companies (Telscom, Martel, etc.), NRENs and many others, mainly in the context of RACE and
                        ACTS projects like ISABEL, BRAIN, IBER, EXPLOIT, BINET, CATALYST, EXPERT, NICE,
                        BETEUS, TECODIS, etc. Isabel enabled the set up of distributed events over the first broadband
                        networks, fostering innovation and new services.</p>

                    <p>The first service was the tele-conference service supporting distributed conferences like the
                        BRAIN
                        Summer Schools. In 1996 the TECODIS project created the ISABEL tele-work service, for more
                        informal distributed work meetings. The tele-class service for distributed classroom creation
                        came
                        shortly after.</p>


                    <p>ISABEL was ported to IPv6 in 1998. It was probably the first complex application completely
                        ported
                        to the new version of the IP Protocol. An IPv6 porting guide was generated summarizing the
                        experience, which was used as a reference in several IPv6 Task Forces. ISABEL was used to
                        perform some of the first IPv6 Summits as distributed events over the first IPv6 enabled
                        infrastructures.</p>

                    <p>After two decades of creating collaboration services and events, ISABEL did not survive the
                        emergence of the cloud for Internet service provision. Nevertheless the ISABEL software evolved
                        into Lynckia/Licode ( <a href="http://lynckia.com/licode" target="_blank">lynckia.com/licode</a>
                        ,
                        <a href="https://github.com/lynckia/licode" target="_blank">github.com/lynckia/licode</a> ), the
                        first WebRTC
                        MCU released as open software. Lynckia/Licode is being used today to implement real time voice
                        and video collaboration by companies like, <a href="https://www.mashme.io/"
                            target="_blank">MashMe.io</a>, <a href="https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/" target="_blank">
                            Minerva Schools at KGI</a> , <a href="https://www.knuddels.de/" target="_blank">
                            knuddles</a>, ...</p>

                    <p>The Lynckia/Licode based “Room of the Future” created by <a href="https://www.mashme.io/"
                            target="_blank">MashMe.io</a> is probably the closest
                        service to what we did in the “old ISABEL events”. It will be used in the 25th ISABEL
                        Anniversary to
                        connect again old ISABEL sites participating in events during so many years with the new Rooms.
